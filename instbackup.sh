##The script saves the current state of the server's world data and pauses the server's auto-save functionality. Next, it backs up the server's world data directory (world) and places its contents in a timestamped directory (<timestamp>-world) in the Cloud Storage bucket. After the script finishes backing up the data, it resumes auto-saving on the Minecraft server.
